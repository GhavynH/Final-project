      <h1 class="h12">I am Ghavyn this is my page</h1>
        <p class="p1">  My name is Ghavyn. I have always liked technology, so after some motivation from family, I ended up taking the Websites for Beginners course.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p1">  I do know how to add a background image, but what is more calming than a minimalistic grey square? Nothing, thats what. I felt the simple colors and the font that looks like it was drawn in crayon fit my personal aesthetic better, so since this page is about me, for me, I went with what I liked.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p1">  Long story short, I have been enjoying learning to code, and plan to learn more in the future. I enjoy web design, because it feels like a mix of an art and a science, creativity can take you anywhere. I have limited coding experience, but that is made up with extensive tech experience, which goes a long way with learning coding such as HTML and CSS. The rest of the web page will help you get to know me, I hope that you stick around, and maybe even watch the videos below.</p>
